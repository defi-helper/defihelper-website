    title: 'What is DeFiHelper and what is it for?',
    body: `DeFiHelper is a management assistant app for crypto portfolios of any size.
    The app is used for automating and boosting returns on DeFi investments.
    DFH provides a comprehensive overview of the entire portfolio, automates routine actions,
    reports on important market-related events, saves on fees, and helps users earn more on their investments.
    In the near future, users will also be able to find investment strategies on the DFH marketplace or create their own and earn a percentage of
    the profits received from the users who apply them.`
  },

  {
    title: 'How exactly does DeFiHelper help earn more?',
    body: `DeFiHelper can restake tokens automatically and helps users earn more using the power of compound interest. [The mathematical model](${window.location.origin}${articleEN}) developed by the DFH team makes decisions based on fees, token prices, and other factors.

Ready-made, high-yield investment strategies devised by other users can be applied (available soon) and followed. Users can also create their own strategies and earn a percentage of the profits received from the users who apply them.

DeFiHelper monitors and reports on sudden changes in profitability, important market-related events, impermanent loss, as well as changes in a crypto portfolio.`
  },

  {
    title: 'What is the mathematical model behind DeFiHelper?',

The team then initiates the allocation of a budget for the development of such functionality. Payment is made in native DFH tokens. The tokens are allocated gradually in accordance with the schedule that is embedded in a smart contract. This is to incentivize developers to support their code for some time after release. In total, 30% of the total emission of DFH tokens is allocated for development.

If you do not have any programming skills, you can help in other ways by creating content, maintaining chats in local languages, or helping establish partnerships. All contributions are paid in DFH tokens. For more details, please visit the [Tokenomics](/tokenomics) page.`
